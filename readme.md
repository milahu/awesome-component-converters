### runtime adapters

mix two frameworks on runtime

- https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder - Drag and drop Visual CMS for React, Vue, Angular, and more
- https://podium-lib.io/ - server side composition of microfrontends, "javascript iframes", Podium is a library for building micro frontends. "Micro frontends" is a concept that advocates letting go of the monolith and instead putting all functionallity into smaller independent servers with each server being responsible for serving individual parts of the page in isolation (page fragments) and then composing them together into whole pages in separate layers. The composition is done by requesting each independent fragment over HTTP and then putting each fragment into the HTML page's markup.

- https://github.com/namecheap/ilc - Isomorphic Layout Composer (ILC) - a layout service that composes a web page from fragment services. It supports client/server-based page composition. ILC assembles a page on the server-side using apps that support Server-side rendering (SSR), and after that, the page is passed on the client-side, so the client-side rendering handles all further navigation.

### i18n

also a "translation" but i18n means the translation between human languages
